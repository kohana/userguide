# Writing a good userguide

A userguide is a fantastic way to communicate to developers and users the intention of a module and how to properly use it. A good userguide will contain examples as well as comments on what you should focus your attention on when using it.

The first goal of a userguide is to spare those who are going to use it the time to go through all the code in order to understand how it works. First and foremost, it must be a high level description of how you should interact with the module and what results you can expect.

# How to navigate a userguide

A userguide in itself can be compared to a wiki page. It contains information about a source of interest. There's two ways you can navigate from pages to pages:

* Using the side bar

On most page, you'll notice there is a left side bar containing links to other sections of the current guide. This allows the user to consult those various sections. The size and sectioning of each page is up to the documentation writer.

* Using the links provided on the page

While you're reading user documentation, you might see some links through the page. Those are a great way to point the user to other documentation that might be useful to understand the current userguide they are reading.

# How are things organized in a userguide?

The organization of a userguide is once again up to the documentation writer. In most case though, it will make sense to briefly introduce the userguide of your module by explaining the goal of the module, if it depends on anything else (PHP version, other modules, etc.) as well as potential information on how to get future releases.

Then it is onto the module documentation itself. This will vary between modules, because each module is unique.
