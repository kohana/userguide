Kohana user guide and live API documentation module

**Note to Contributors**

Just so you are aware, I am not merging forks of forks. As the owner of a translation language, I expect you to merge the downstream forks into your own. For instance:

    kohana/userguide
    -- you/userguide-xx
    -- -- person/userguide-xx

All changes from `person/userguide-xx` must be merged into your own repo, using `git merge` or the fork queue. See [github forking](http://help.github.com/forking/) for more information about how to merge remote repositories, and note that you will need to add a remote for `person/userguide-xx` using:

    git remote add person git://github.com/person/userguide-xx
    git pull person master

Thanks for you help!
